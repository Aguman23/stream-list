    Welcome to Stream List. A web application made for helping you

recommend content to your friends and social networks. Share your
favorite movies and shows from all major streaming services through lists generated into images.

    Start by creating lists and add entries in them. In each

entry add the title you want to add, rate how much you
enjoyed the content from 1-10, and leave comments on your
thoughts of the title. Hit the preview button when you're
done, and download your list at the end of the preview page.

In terminal type npm i to add the installs to the project.
Npm start to start it.
